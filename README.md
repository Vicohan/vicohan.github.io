I am currently a third year M.sc. student in the Department of Entomology, South China Agriculutural University, supervised by A/Prof. Xiaoling Fan. Now mainly working on mitochondrial genome, molecular phylogeny, taxonomy and evolution in Hesperiidae (Lepidoptera). Previously, I received the bachelor's degrees from Department of Plant Protection in Yangtze University in 2011, under the supervision of Prof. Chuanren Li, and mainly study insect behavior and ecology.

I am very interested in the intersection of biology and information science. I hope to analyze the data through a computer platform to solve biological problems accurately, or to explore the development of more suitable biological tools.
